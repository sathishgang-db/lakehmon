# Lakehmon -- The Monster in the Lakehouse
The repo shows how you can build cross platform applications with [Flutter](flutter.dev) , FASTAPI and the Databricks APIs. Specifically, we use Databricks Serverless Serving capability to demonstrate the features of this web/desktop application. 

The web applications requires the intermediary - i.e. FASTAPI service to collect and send requests out to databricks while the desktop application does not. You can choose to try out the application in either way or both.

For reference,here's the complete architecture which assumes that you'd need the backend service
