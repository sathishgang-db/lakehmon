The repo shows how you can build cross platform applications with [Flutter](flutter.dev) , FASTAPI and the Databricks APIs. Specifically, we use Databricks Serverless Serving capability to demonstrate the features of this web/desktop application. 

The web applications requires the intermediary - i.e. FASTAPI service to collect and send requests out to databricks while the desktop application does not. You can choose to try out the application in either way or both.
